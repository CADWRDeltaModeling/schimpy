SCHIMPY Toolset
========================

The *schimpy* toolset is designed to help to pre- and post-process SCHISM
simulations more easily. In particular, the tools allow you
to specify things like boundaries and hydraulic structures using
geophysical coordinates rather than node/element numbers ... this
can greatly simplify the work involved when the mesh is revised.

Please direct questions, suggestions or bug reports to
Eli.Ateljevich@water.ca.gov or Kijin.Nam@water.ca.gov.

Usage
