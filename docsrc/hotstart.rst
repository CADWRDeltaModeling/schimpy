SCHISM hotstart
===============

Examples
--------



Examples to create hotstart.nc for the following cases can be found 
in `BayDeltaSCHISM <https://github.com/CADWRDeltaModeling/BayDeltaSCHISM>`_
All test cases are under the directory `examples/hotstart/ <https://github.com/CADWRDeltaModeling/BayDeltaSCHISM/tree/master/examples/hotstart>`
All test cases start from the same date and has the same destination grid.

Steps
-----

To create a hotstart:

#. Edit yaml file "hotstart.yaml": date, hgrid_input_file, and vgrid_input_file. 
    
#. Create domain division poplygons in a shapefile. For most applications, users can directly use hotstart_regions.shp in BayDeltaSCHISM/examples/hotstart/shapefile without any modification. However, if your domain is larger than the area covered by the polygon, an error will be generated: "Orphaned nodes or cells found at ........" Most of time, polygon overlapping should not be allowed (allow_overlap=False), except in "island_flooding" test case where "allow_overlap" is set to True.  

   * Note that it is the responsibility of the users to create polygons that are non overlapping and complete. 
  
   * Hint: enable "snapping options" in qgis (normally under "project" menu) to create non overlaying polygons or us SMS instead. 

#. Prepare extrude_casts data for San Francisco Bay.
   * It is the user's responsiblity to create the cast data file
  
   * An `example file <https://github.com/CADWRDeltaModeling/BayDeltaSCHISM/blob/master/examples/hotstart/data_in/polaris_transect_2021-04-20.csv>` is provided to demonstrate the format of the data file.
  
   * USGS data is available from \\cnrastore-bdo\Modeling_Data\usgs_cruise. 
  
   * Decide if suisun_marsh region should use "extrude_casts" or "obs_points". The general rule is that "extrude_casts" works best in the bay and observed data works best in the marsh. 
    
#. Prepare input data from observations.
   * It is the user's responsiblity to create the observational input files. `Example input files <https://github.com/CADWRDeltaModeling/BayDeltaSCHISM/blob/master/examples/hotstart/data_in>` are provided to demonstrate the format of the file.

#. Run python script "create_hotstart.py".
