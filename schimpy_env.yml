# Note, though these are listed below as if conda would use pip
# we do not recommend that you uncomment and use conda to install them via pip. 
# Instead, if you want a developer install, leave these libraries above
# which helps ensure that conda rather than pip handles the dependencies of each. 
# Then do a github clone, go to the parent directory and run `pip install --no-deps -e .`
